To install just run the install script:

```
$ ./install.sh
```

In order to get powerline working properly you will have to install powerline fonts from https://github.com/powerline/fonts

Also make sure you are using ``xterm-256color`` as your ``TERM``. You can do that by adding the following line to your ``~/.bashrc``:

```
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
